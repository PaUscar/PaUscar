# Hola  👋🏾

I'm Oscar Perales, rookie Data Scientist. I'm excited to pivot into this new world and learn amazing things. 


#  About Me ✍🏾

I'm a life long entreprenuer who's first startup was acquired. After the acquistion, I craved something new being a logic minded individual. Data Science captured my attention and I fell in love with the process. I bring a very unique perpective to the field by having strong business acumen and the ability to notice pattern recognitions when looking at data. 

- ⚖️ I'm intersted in a balanced array of data science projects.
- 📚 I consider myself a life long learner since I began my journey with Computer Science later in life. I'm open to feedback on any repo.
